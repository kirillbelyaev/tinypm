        it will not allow to recreate the directory .... 
        Probably the main motivation behind this design is the fact that only
        a single tuple space is allowed within an IRE (Isolated Runtime
        Environment) because only a single application is deployed in it...
        Therefore it is easier for LPM to just check a single TS directory 
        location using uniform naming convention instead of assuming TS name 
        that is given by the internal application logic. 
        Sort of similar to UNIX domain sockets convention. */
